\chapter{Evaluating capacitive proximity sensors in smart environments}
\label{ch:eval}
In the previous sections I have presented background information on capacitive proximity sensors and various prototypes of this technology in different application domains within smart environments. These overview included both an analysis of existing prototypes from literature, as well as a collection of own prototypes that were developed in the last years. With this as basis, it is now possible to perform a meta-analysis to identify common patterns and identify benefits and limitations of the technology within smart environments. The section is distinguished into four different parts. First, I will compare capacitive proximity sensing to other sensing technologies that are commonly used in smart environments. Afterwards, limitations and benefits of the technology are identified and discussed in detail. I will conclude with a set of guidelines that may help other researchers when designing smart environment applications based on capacitive proximity sensors. This section is an extended form of the discussion found of a working paper to be released in a journal soon  \cite{braun2014capjaise}.
