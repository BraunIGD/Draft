\chapter{Evaluating capacitive proximity sensors in smart environments}
\label{ch:eval}
In the previous sections we have presented back-ground information on capacitive proximity sensors and various prototypes of this technology in different application domains within smart environments. In the following section we are building on the collected information to perform a meta-analysis of the acquired data, discussing benefits and limitations of the technology, compare it to competing technologies and give some guidelines to parties interested in developing further applications in this domain.
