\chapter{Use cases for capacitive proximity sensors}
\label{ch:usecases}
After having defined the potential application domains for capacitive proximity sensors, in the following section I would like to evaluate the actual use cases by presenting associated challenges, presenting data processing methods on how to tackle these, and present a number of prototypes that have been created implementing these methods. This allows to gather the information required to discuss the application of capacitive proximity sensors in smart environments and validate their use in Chapter \ref{ch:eval}. In addition to the application specific challenges there are also numerous implementation challenges that are detailed in the descriptions of the associated prototypes.
