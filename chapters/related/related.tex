\chapter{Related Work}
In this section I will describe the most relevant works that inspired this work  or are linked to a specific topic. The aim of this section is to provide a basis for both, the benchmarking model that is developed in section \ref{ch:benchmark}, and the capacitive proximity sensing prototypes described in section \ref{ch:proto}. The related works are distinguished into four distinct parts. At first I will give a general introduction to electric field sensing, including a discussion on different properties, physical background, the influence of materials and geometry and different data processing methods. Afterwards I will  present relevant applications using capacitive proximity sensing, ranging from historical works to very recent systems. In the next section various sensing technologies are introduced that are used in smart environment systems. Finally I will identify and group different applications in smart environments, providing a basis for the benchmarking model.
